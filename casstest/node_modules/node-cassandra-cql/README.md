## Node.js CQL Driver for Apache Cassandra

Node.js CQL driver for [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) with a small dependency tree written in pure javascript.

The driver uses Cassandra's binary protocol which was introduced in Cassandra version 1.2.

## Installation

    $ npm install node-cassandra-cql

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jorgebay/node-cassandra-cql.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jorgebay/node-cassandra-cql)

## Features
- Connection pooling to multiple hosts
- Load balancing and automatic failover
- Plain Old Javascript: no need to generate thrift files
- [Long][1] and [uuid][0] support
- Row and field streaming

## Using it
```javascript
//Creating a new connection pool to multiple hosts.
var cql = require('node-cassandra-cql');
var client = new cql.Client({hosts: ['host1:9042', 'host2:9042'], keyspace: 'keyspace1'});
//Reading
client.execute('SELECT key, email, last_name FROM user_profiles WHERE key=?', ['jbay'],
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) console.log('execute failed');
    else console.log('got user profile with email ' + result.rows[0].email);
  }
);

//Writing
client.execute('UPDATE user_profiles SET birth=? WHERE key=?', [new Date(1950, 5, 1), 'jbay'],
  cql.types.consistencies.quorum,
  function(err) {
    if (err) console.log('failure');
    else console.log('success');
  }
);

//Streaming query rows
client.eachRow('SELECT event_time, temperature FROM temperature WHERE station_id=', ['abc'],
  function(n, row) {
    //the callback will be invoked per each row as soon as they are received
    console.log('temperature value', n, row.temperature);
  },
  function (err, rowLength) {
    if (err) console.log('Oh dear...');
    console.log('%d rows where returned', rowLength);
  }
);

//Streaming field
client.streamField('SELECT key, photo FROM user_profiles WHERE key=', ['jbay'], 
  function(err, row, photoStream) {
    //the callback will be invoked per each row as soon as they are received.
    if (err) console.log('Shame...');
    else {
      //The stream is a Readable Stream2 object
      stdout.pipe(photoStream);
    }
  }
);

//The whole result set as a stream
client.stream('SELECT time1, value1 FROM timeseries WHERE key=', ['key123'])
  .on('readable', function () {
    //readable is emitted as soon a row is received and parsed
    var row;
    while (row = this.read()) {
      console.log('time %s and value %s', row.time1, row.value1);
    }
  })
  .on('end', function () {
    //stream ended, there aren't any more rows
  })
  .on('error', function (err) {
    //Something went wrong: err is a response error from Cassandra
  });
```

## API
### Client

The `Client` maintains a pool of opened connections to the hosts to avoid several time-consuming steps that are involved with the setup of a CQL binary protocol connection (socket connection, startup message, authentication, ...).

*The Client is the recommended driver class to interact with Cassandra nodes*.

#### new Client(options)

Constructs a new client object.

`options` is an object with these slots, only `hosts` is required:
```
                hosts: Array of string in host:port format. Port is optional (default 9042).
             keyspace: Name of keyspace to use.
             username: User for authentication.
             password: Password for authentication.
            staleTime: Time in milliseconds before trying to reconnect to a node.
    maxExecuteRetries: Maximum amount of times an execute can be retried
                       using another connection, in case the server is unhealthy.
getAConnectionTimeout: Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for a connection from the pool.
             poolSize: Number of connections to open for each host (default 1)
```

#### client.connect([callback])

Connects / warms up the pool.

It ensures the pool is connected. It is not required to call it, internally the driver will call to `connect` when executing a query.

The optional `callback` parameter will be executed when the pool is connected. If the pool is already connected, it will be called instantly. 

#### client.execute(query, [params], [consistency], callback)  

Executes a CQL query.

The `query` is the cql query to execute, with `?` placeholders as parameters.

Use one of the values defined in `types.consistencies` for  `consistency`, defaults to quorum.

Callback should take two arguments err and result.

*The driver will replace the placeholders with the `params`, stringified into the query*.

#### client.executeAsPrepared(query, [params], [consistency], callback)

Prepares (the first time) and executes the prepared query.

To execute a prepared query, the `params` are binary serialized. Using **prepared statements increases performance**, especially for repeated queries.

In the case the query is already being prepared on a host, it queues the executing of a prepared statement on that host until the preparing finished (the driver will not issue a request to prepare statement more than once).

Use one of the values defined in `types.consistencies` for  `consistency`, defaults to quorum.

Callback should take two arguments err and result.

#### client.eachRow(query, [params], [consistency], rowCallback, endCallback)

Prepares (the first time), executes the prepared query and streams the rows as soon as they are received.

It executes `rowCallback(n, row)` per each row received, where `n` is the index of the row.

It executes `endCallback(err, rowLength)` when all rows have been received or there is an error retrieving the row.

Use one of the values defined in `types.consistencies` for  `consistency`, defaults to quorum.

#### client.streamField(query, [params], [consistency], rowCallback, [endCallback])

Prepares (the first time), executes the prepared query and streams the last field of each row.

It executes `rowCallback(n, row, streamField)` per each row as soon as the first chunk of the last field is received, where `n` is the index of the row.

The `stream` is a [Readable Streams2](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable) object that contains the raw bytes of the field value.
It can be **piped** downstream and provides automatic pause/resume logic (it buffers when not read).

The `row` object is similar to the one provided on `eachRow`, except that it does not contain the definition of the last column.

Use one of the values defined in `types.consistencies` for  `consistency`, defaults to quorum.

It executes `endCallback(err, rowLength)` when all rows have been received or there is an error retrieving the row.

#### client.stream(query, [params], [consistency], [callback])

Returns a [Readable Streams2](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable) object in `objectMode`.
When a row can be read from the stream, it will emit a `readable` event.
It can be **piped** downstream and provides automatic pause/resume logic (it buffers when not read).

Prepares (the first time), executes the prepared query.

Use one of the values defined in `types.consistencies` for  `consistency`, defaults to quorum.

It executes `callback(err)` when all rows have been received or there is an error retrieving the row.

#### client.shutdown([callback])

Disconnects the pool.

Closes all connections in the pool. Normally, it should be called once in your application lifetime.

The optional `callback` parameter will be executed when the pool is disconnected.

### Connection

In the case that you need lower level fine-grained control you could use the `Connection` class.

It represents a connection to a Cassandra node. The consumer has to take care of open and close it.

#### new Connection(options)

Constructs a new connection object.

#### open(callback) 

Establishes a connection, authenticates and sets a keyspace.

#### close(callback)

Closes the connection to a Cassandra node.

#### execute(query, args, consistency, callback)

Executes a CQL query.

#### prepare(query, callback)

Prepares a CQL query.

#### executePrepared(queryId, args, consistency, callback)

Executes a previously prepared query (determined by the queryId).

----

### types

The `types` module contains field definitions that are useful to interact with Cassandra nodes.

#### consistencies

Object that contains the CQL consistencies defined as properties. For example: `consistencies.one`, `consistencies.quorum`, ...

#### dataTypes

Object that contains all the [CQL data types](http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html#types) defined as properties.

#### responseErrorCodes

Object containing all the possible response error codes returned by Cassandra defined as properties.

#### Long()

Constructs a 64-bit two's-complement integer. See [Long API Documentation](http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/class_goog_math_Long.html).

#### timeuuid()

Function to generate a uuid __v1__. It uses [node-uuid][0] module to generate and accepts the same arguments.

#### uuid()

Function to generate a uuid __v4__. It uses [node-uuid][0] module to generate and accepts the same arguments.

----

## Logging

Instances of `Client()` and `Connection()` are `EventEmitter`'s and emit `log` events:
```javascript
client.on('log', function(level, message) {
  console.log('log event: %s -- %j', level, message);
});
```
The `level` being passed to the listener can be `info` or `error`.

## Data types

Cassandra's bigint data types are parsed as [Long][1].

List / Set datatypes are encoded from / decoded to Javascript Arrays.

Map datatype are encoded from / decoded to Javascript objects with keys as props.

Decimal and Varint are not parsed yet, they are yielded as byte Buffers.

[Check the documentation for data type support →](https://github.com/jorgebay/node-cassandra-cql/wiki/Data-types)

## FAQ

#### How can specify the target data type of a query parameter?
The driver tries to guess the target data type, if you want to set the target data type use a param object with
the **hint** and **value** properties.

All the cassandra data types are defined in the object `types.dataTypes`.

For example:

```javascript
//hint as string
var keyParam = {value: key, hint: 'int'};
client.executeAsPrepared('SELECT * from users where k=?', [keyParam], callback);

//hint using dataTypes
var keyParam = {value: key, hint: types.dataTypes.int};
client.executeAsPrepared('SELECT * from users where k=?', [keyParam], callback);
```

#### Should I shutdown the pool after executing a query?
No, you should only call `client.shutdown` once in your application lifetime.
